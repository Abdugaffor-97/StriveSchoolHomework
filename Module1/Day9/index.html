<!--
            BINGO CHALLENGE!!!
            Create programmatically (with JS) a BINGO board with 76 cells, from 1 to 76.
            Create a button to randomize a number from 1 to 76. The same number should be highlighted on the bingo board
    
            EXTRA: 
            - Take ALWAYS a new number (avoid randoming 10 3 times for example)
            - Create a USER BOARD with random 24 numbers that highlights as the main board does
            - Let the user choose HOW MANY user boards he's willing to play with and create them.
